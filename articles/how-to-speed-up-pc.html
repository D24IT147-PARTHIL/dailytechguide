                <h2>Why Computers Slow Down Over Time</h2>
                <p>Before fixing the problem, it helps to understand it. Windows PCs typically slow down for a handful
                    of well-understood reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Startup overload:</strong> Every program you install adds itself to startup. After a few
                        years, 20–30 programs fight for resources the moment you turn on your PC.</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage fragmentation (HDDs):</strong> Traditional hard drives store files in fragments
                        across the disk. Over time, the drive has to search multiple locations for each file — slowing
                        everything down.</li>
                    <li><strong>Background processes:</strong> Antivirus scans, update services, syncing tools, and
                        bloatware consume CPU and RAM even when you're not actively using them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thermal throttling:</strong> When a CPU gets too hot, it deliberately slows itself down.
                        Dust-clogged vents are a silent performance killer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ageing hardware:</strong> A 5–8 year-old computer is simply reaching the limit of what
                        it can handle with modern software and web applications.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With this in mind, here are 15 specific fixes — ordered from easiest to most involved.</p>

                <h2>Free Fixes (Do These First)</h2>

                <h3>1. Disable Unnecessary Startup Programs</h3>
                <p>This is the single highest-impact free fix for most slow Windows PCs. Right-click the taskbar → Task
                    Manager → Startup tab. You'll see every program that launches on boot with its startup impact
                    rating. Disable anything you don't need immediately on startup. Common culprits: Spotify, OneDrive,
                    Discord, Adobe Creative Cloud, Teams.</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> Boot time can improve by 30–90 seconds. Background RAM usage drops
                    significantly.</p>

                <h3>2. Restart Your PC Regularly</h3>
                <p>Many people leave their computer in sleep mode for days or weeks. Memory leaks accumulate, temporary
                    files grow, and background processes pile up. A full restart clears RAM, applies pending updates,
                    and refreshes system processes. If your PC feels sluggish and you haven't restarted in days — start
                    there.</p>

                <h3>3. Clear Temporary Files</h3>
                <p>Windows accumulates gigabytes of temporary files over time — update remnants, cache files, browser
                    data, and leftover installation files. Use the built-in <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong>: search for
                    "Disk Cleanup" in the Start menu, select your C: drive, check all options, and click "Clean up
                    system files" for a deeper clean. On Windows 11, Settings > System > Storage > Temporary Files gives
                    you finer control. Most PCs gain 5–20 GB of free space from this step alone.</p>

                <h3>4. Enable Storage Sense / Defragment Your Drive</h3>
                <p>For <strong>HDD users:</strong> Open "Defragment and Optimise Drives" (search in Start menu) and run
                    optimisation on your C: drive. This rearranges fragments for faster sequential read. Schedule it
                    monthly.</p>
                <p>For <strong>SSD users:</strong> Don't defragment — it's harmful to SSDs. Instead, ensure TRIM is
                    enabled (it should be by default on Windows 10/11). SSDs don't need defragmentation; their random
                    access speed is already fast regardless of file arrangement.</p>

                <h3>5. Adjust Power Settings</h3>
                <p>If your laptop is set to "Power Saver" mode, your CPU is intentionally throttled to extend battery
                    life. For desktop performance: Control Panel > Power Options > Set to "High Performance" or
                    "Balanced." On laptops, use "Balanced" on battery and "High Performance" when plugged in for
                    intensive work.</p>

                <h3>6. Update Windows and Drivers</h3>
                <p>Outdated drivers — especially graphics card and storage controller drivers — can cause significant
                    performance issues. Run Windows Update (Settings > Windows Update > Check for Updates). For graphics
                    drivers: download latest directly from NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel's website rather than relying on
                    Windows Update, which sometimes lags behind. A fresh driver version often provides noticeable
                    performance improvements, especially for gaming.</p>

                <h3>7. Scan for Malware</h3>
                <p>Malware — particularly cryptomining software and adware — can silently consume massive CPU and RAM.
                    Run a full scan with Windows Defender (free and effective) or Malwarebytes Free. Cryptomining
                    malware can push CPU to 80–100% usage constantly, dramatically slowing everything else while costing
                    you in electricity bills.</p>

                <h3>8. Reduce Visual Effects</h3>
                <p>Windows' fancy animations and transparency effects look nice but cost performance on older hardware.
                    Search "Adjust the appearance and performance of Windows" → Select "Adjust for best performance" for
                    maximum speed, or manually uncheck specific effects like animations and shadows. This is
                    particularly effective on PCs with less than 4GB of RAM.</li>
                </p>

                <h3>9. Free Up RAM with Task Manager</h3>
                <p>Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) → Processes tab → Sort by Memory. Identify high memory consumers.
                    Browser tabs are usually the biggest culprit — Chrome and Edge are notorious RAM consumers. Closing
                    unused tabs and browser windows immediately returns memory to the system. If Chrome or Edge
                    consistently uses over 2–3GB of RAM, consider limiting tabs or using an extension like "The Great
                    Suspender" to auto-suspend idle tabs.</p>

                <h3>10. Reinstall Windows (Nuclear Option — But It Works)</h3>
                <p>If your PC has been running the same Windows installation for 4+ years, a clean reinstall can
                    genuinely feel like a new computer. Modern Windows 11 allows you to "Reset this PC" (Settings >
                    System > Recovery) and choose whether to keep your files. This removes accumulated bloatware, broken
                    registry entries, and software conflicts. Budget 2–3 hours and back up your data first.</p>

                <h2>Hardware Upgrades (Worth the Investment)</h2>

                <h3>11. Upgrade to an SSD (Highest Impact Upgrade)</h3>
                <p>If your computer is still running on a traditional Hard Disk Drive (HDD), this is the single most
                    transformative upgrade you can make. An SSD (Solid State Drive) can make a 5-year-old computer feel
                    fast again. Boot times go from 2–3 minutes to 15–25 seconds. Apps open nearly instantly. File
                    transfers are dramatically faster.</p>
                <p><strong>India pricing context:</strong> A quality 500GB SSD (Samsung 870 EVO, Crucial MX500, WD Blue)
                    costs ₹3,500–5,500. A 1TB SSD costs ₹5,500–8,000. The labour of cloning your existing drive (migrate
                    your OS without reinstalling) is ₹500–1,000 at most PC repair shops. This upgrade on a 4–8 year old
                    laptop with an HDD is almost always worth doing.</p>

                <h3>12. Add More RAM</h3>
                <p>If your PC has 4GB of RAM, it's struggling with modern Windows usage. 8GB is the realistic minimum
                    for smooth operation in 2025; 16GB is ideal for multitasking. RAM is relatively inexpensive: 8GB
                    DDR4 RAM costs ₹1,800–2,500 in India. Before buying, check your motherboard's maximum supported RAM
                    and the number of available slots.</p>

                <h3>13. Clean the Cooling System</h3>
                <p>Dust builds up inside laptops and desktops over the years, blocking airflow and causing thermal
                    throttling. A laptop running at 95°C will deliberately reduce its CPU speed to avoid damage — and
                    you'll feel it as sluggishness, particularly under load. Clean your vents with compressed air
                    (available at most electronics stores in India for ₹300–400 a can). For desktops, open the case and
                    clean thoroughly. Do this every 12–18 months.</p>

                <h3>14. Upgrade Your Internet Connection and Browser</h3>
                <p>If your PC feels slow primarily while browsing, the bottleneck may be your internet connection, not
                    your hardware. Test your actual speed at speedtest.net — if you're getting significantly less than
                    your plan speed, contact your ISP. Also switch browsers: Brave and Firefox are consistently lighter
                    on RAM than Chrome; Edge has improved significantly and may outperform Chrome on Windows systems by
                    design.</p>

                <h3>15. Consider Replacing Thermal Paste (Laptops 3+ Years Old)</h3>
                <p>The thermal paste between your CPU/GPU and heatsink degrades over 3–4 years, reducing heat transfer
                    efficiency and causing thermal throttling. Replacing it (with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut or similar)
                    can drop operating temperatures by 10–15°C, allowing the CPU to run at full speed. This is a
                    slightly technical process — worth doing yourself if you're comfortable opening your laptop, or
                    paying ₹300–600 at a service centre to have done.</p>

                <h2>Pros and Cons of the Major Speed-Up Methods</h2>
                <h3>Software Fixes (Free)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>✅ No cost</li>
                    <li>✅ Safe and reversible</li>
                    <li>✅ Immediate effect</li>
                    <li>❌ Limited if hardware is the fundamental bottleneck</li>
                    <li>❌ Require periodic maintenance (they won't permanently fix an old, slow HDD)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Hardware Upgrades</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>✅ Genuinely transformative — especially SSD and RAM upgrades</li>
                    <li>✅ Multi-year lifespan extension for ageing hardware</li>
                    <li>✅ Cheaper than buying a new computer</li>
                    <li>❌ Upfront cost</li>
                    <li>❌ Not always possible on ultra-thin laptops (RAM may be soldered)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Mistakes People Make When Trying to Speed Up Their PC</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Installing "PC optimizer" software:</strong> Most PC optimizer tools you see advertised
                        online are either useless, harmful, or outright malware. Windows has all the optimisation tools
                        you need built in.</li>
                    <li><strong>Defragmenting an SSD:</strong> This doesn't help and slowly wears out the SSD. Only
                        defragment HDDs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ignoring browser tab count:</strong> 30 open Chrome tabs can consume 4–6GB of RAM.
                        Managing tabs is free and immediate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Upgrading to maximum RAM when storage is the bottleneck:</strong> If you have 8GB of RAM
                        but are running on a spinning HDD, adding more RAM won't noticeably help. Fix the SSD first.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Start with the free fixes — disable startup programs, clear temp files, and scan for malware. These
                    alone can recover significant performance on most aging machines. If your hardware is genuinely old
                    (5+ years) with a spinning hard drive, the SSD upgrade is the single best investment you can make —
                    it will likely be more impactful than buying a new budget laptop.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>Why is my new laptop already running slow?</h3>
                <p>New laptops — especially budget models — often come pre-loaded with bloatware: trial software,
                    carrier apps, and vendor utilities that launch at startup and consume resources. Open Task Manager →
                    Startup tab and disable everything unnecessary. Also check Settings > Apps > Installed Apps and
                    uninstall the pre-loaded software you don't need. This alone can make a significant difference on a
                    new machine.</p>

                <h3>How do I know if my PC needs more RAM or an SSD?</h3>
                <p>Open Task Manager during your normal workload (when your PC feels slow). If RAM usage is consistently
                    above 85–90%, more RAM will help. If RAM is fine but your disk shows 100% usage (check the Disk
                    column in Task Manager's Performance tab), your HDD is the bottleneck — an SSD upgrade will have a
                    transformative effect. Often the answer is both, but the SSD delivers more noticeable improvement
                    for most users.</p>

                <h3>Will upgrading to Windows 11 speed up my PC?</h3>
                <p>Not reliably, and possibly the opposite. Windows 11 has higher system requirements than Windows 10 —
                    on a PC with 4GB of RAM or an HDD, Windows 11 may actually run slightly slower. However, if your
                    hardware meets the minimum specs comfortably (8GB RAM, SSD, modern CPU), Windows 11 is generally
                    comparable to Windows 10 in performance and offers security benefits worth having. Check
                    compatibility first using the PC Health Check app from Microsoft.</p>

                <h3>Is it worth buying a PC optimizer app?</h3>
                <p>No — and some are actively harmful. Most advertised PC optimizers do everything Windows already does
                    for free (disk cleanup, startup management), wrapped in a paid subscription. Some "optimization"
                    tools classify legitimate system processes as threats to scare users into buying premium versions.
                    Stick to Windows' built-in tools and free options like Malwarebytes for malware scanning.</p>

                <h3>How much should I budget for an SSD upgrade in India?</h3>
                <p>For a desktop or older laptop with a 2.5" drive bay: ₹3,000–5,000 for a quality 500GB SATA SSD
                    (Samsung, Western Digital, or Crucial). For a modern laptop needing an M.2 NVMe SSD: ₹4,000–7,000
                    for 512GB. Adding ₹500–800 for professional installation and OS cloning at a local service centre is
                    worth it if you're not comfortable doing it yourself. Total investment of ₹4,000–6,000 typically
                    extends a laptop's useful life by 2–4 years.</p>
